# War! The Card Game

Vanilla JavaScript game based on "war" card game, using stolen background image, font-awesome for random suits that don't match a real deck, slightly modified bootstrap 4 / bootswatch cyborg styling, and custom styles. What more could you ask for?

This game's "winner" is solely dependent upon the numerical values ascribed to the card, as the suits are random and insignificant to the compared value.

This project was originally created in a run without referencing materials as a test for JS comprehension.

To run from terminal:
python -m http.server
